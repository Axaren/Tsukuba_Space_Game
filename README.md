## UPDATES

#### 23/05/2018 - v.0.0.1 :

We are currently implementing Axeran's prototype from LUA to LibGDX. It should take a week and we are very short on time because we still don't have any graphics/sfx.

What we have : 
- Our ECS (Ashley) is implemented.
- Handling Inputs > Player and Camera.
- The camera follow the player. There is also a system of locked and unlocked camera.

## CONTEXT 

This is a game that we (Nathan Lesne and me, Thomas Barré-Pitous) are currently developping with the help of Claus Aranha, teacher at the University of Tsukuba.
This project is a part of our internship abroad at the University of Tsukuba (筑波大学), Japan, proposed by the IUT Computer Science Department of Bordeaux.

The subject of this internship is "Game Development" and we are currently using LibGDX for our project. 

Our goal is to create a video game from scratch using Java or LUA and understand the process of creating a video game.
